# Who is this lovable scamp?
Frisbee is a cactus that lives on my window sill. 
She has been here since I started college, and has been fed a consistant serving of coffee grounds and water.
She does nothing but absorb sunlight that barely touches the Quad buildings, and stare at me despondently while I snoop around Newgrounds.
The code is based on what might be her feelings while sitting next to a box fan, which can be easily edited to anyone else's plants.
It's called the "Not So Smart Plant" because the code is finicky at best, and incomprehensable at worst.
You will not know what is wrong with it until it's too obvious.

I feel as if this reflects Frisbee in some Black Mirror way.
She's a mess of coffee grounds and Brick Prison sunlight, stuck in the corner of a window sill, forced to watch her owner panic over deadlines.
All while doing nothing about it.
If I was in her shoes, I would want to make my life a living hell as well.
