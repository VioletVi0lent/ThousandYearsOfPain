# GEN_RUSH || The CPX game

GEN RUSH is a very simple, short timing game based on reaction time.

It's based on the Dead By Daylight Generator minigames, hense the name.

## Rules!

Once the board starts, and after a set amount of time, the game will start with a sound cue, letting you know something is about to happen.

The only buttons active are the A and B buttons.

Play right, and you win points. Play wrong, and you lose points.

## Objective: Win

Simple as. Every time you hit the correct position, you win points. Every time you miss your mark, you lose points.

Reach the cap, and you'll win the game.

Losing points costs a heavy fine, so consecutive hits are key to winning.

Once the game is over, however, you will need to press the Reset button found on your board.

## The Buttons.

The A button is used to stop your mark in the designated areas, giving you points.

The B button is used to change the difficulty of the game, increasing the length of the game and decreasing the time you have to score points.

## The Score.

Every correct spot hit increases score by 100.

Every spot missed decreases score by 300.

On normal, the score limit is 1000.
On hard, the score limit is 1500.

Once the score limit is reached, the board will light up and stop playing.
