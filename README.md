## Basic Description
GEN_RUSH is a CPX Arduino game availible to all Circuit Playground Express devices.
It is loosely based on the Generator Minigames from Dead by Daylight.

## Specifications
The premise is simple. A dot will start at the far end of the board, and will run to the other side, where it will then loop around.
Your job is to land the dot in the small zone to gain points.
Gain enough points, and you win.
Watch out, however, as missing your mark will deduct points.

## Rules
1. You are the bright blue dot.
2. You must land in the white zones. Landing anywhere else is a point deduction.
3. Get enough points to win.
